Welcome to “MMLoSo Language Challenge 2025”! India is land of unmatched diversity, especially in terms of spoken languages. Many of these languages are tribal languages, which have a sizable number of speakers. But often, these languages are poorly documented and thus lack the massive annotated corpora that power today’s NLP breakthroughs. Limited digital presence means the native speakers face barriers in healthcare messaging, disaster alerts, e-governance, and educational resources—all of which increasingly rely on text mining and machine translation.

By building open-source systems for LRL ⇆ HRL translation, this competition channels deep‐learning skills toward tangible social impact: making vital information accessible in underserved languages and amplifying the voices of native speakers online. In this competition you will translate between high‐resource languages (HRL) and our focused low‐resource languages (LRL), i.e.:

Hindi ⇆ Bhili
Hindi ⇆ Mundari
Hindi ⇆ Gondi
English ⇆ Santali
By tackling all tracks together, you will help push the frontier of multilingual NLP while building end‐to‐end pipelines that work in data‐sparse settings.

Dataset at a Glance
File	Purpose	Key Columns
bhili-train.csv	Data for Bhili – Hindi translation training	row_id, hindi, bhili
gondari-train.csv	Data for Gondi – Hindi translation training	row_id, hindi, gondi
mundari-train.csv	Data for Mundari – Hindi translation training	row_id, hindi, mundari
santali-train.csv	Data for Santali – English translation training	row_id, english, santali
test.csv	Unlabeled source sentences to translate (released later)	row_id, source_sentence, source_lang, target_lang
All texts are drawn from a private, permissively licensed source, cleaned and curated for research.

Tasks & Expected Outputs
Task	What you submit	Where	Metric
Machine Translation	submission.csv with columns:
row_id, source_lang, source_sentence, target_lang, target_sentence	On Kaggle	BLEU & chrF (tokenized, case-insensitive)
Evaluation Metric
Leaderboard ranks teams by a weighted composite score:

```text Final Score = 0.6 × BLEU + 0.4 × chrF

Why 0.6 / 0.4? Translation quality is harder to push in low-resource settings; the higher weight reflects its research importance.

Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact


Overview
Welcome to MMLoSo Language Challenge 2025! India is land of unmatched diversity, especially in terms of spoken languages. Many of these languages are tribal languages, which have a sizable number of speakers. But often, these languages are poorly documented and thus, lack the massive annotated corpora that power today’s NLP breakthroughs. Bhili, being one of them. Limited digital presence means the native speakers face barriers in health-care messaging, disaster alerts, e-governance, and educational resources—all of which increasingly rely on text mining and machine translation.
